RUN THE PROGRAM:
On startup you will see a login screen. Enter a valid username and password (admin, admin). You will then be presented with the mains screen where you can add and modify appointment information.
Clicking on the radiobuttons will take you to different table views based on what was clicked. Click on the reports button to bring up the reports screen which has table views based on which radio button is clicked.


ADDITIONAL REPORT:
For the additional report, I decided to display reports based on customer. A combo box with ever customers name is added to the screen. When clicking on a customer, the table will list that customers appointments.
I thought a report like this would be neccessary for this type of application.
